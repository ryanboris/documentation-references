## Data Scientis**t Role Description**

At Lambda School you have learned both data science analysis/modeling and how to write code and build systems to take advantage of data science. In build week you will bring everything you've learned together, contributing to a project with students from other programs and adding insight from data.

## **The`Data Engineering`unit explored the following topics:**

- Python Modules, Packages, and Environments
- OOP, Code Style and Reviews
- Containers and Reproducible Builds
- Software Testing, Documentation, and Licensing
- Introduction to SQL, SQL for Analysis
- NoSQL and Document-oriented databases
- ACID and Database Scalability
- AWS, Elastic MapReduce
- Scala, Apache Spark
- Web Applications with Flask
- Consuming data from an API
- Adding Data Science to a Web Application
- Web Application Deployment

## **Your primary role as a Data Scientist**

You will use your skills to be responsible for the analysis and incorporation of data in your project. You will work with your PM to obtain the data (possibly from an API), analyze/model as appropriate to your problem/domain, and then coordinate with the back-end and other developers to deliver results in a usable format (e.g. JSON) for inclusion in the resulting application.
